# DataScience_MachineLearning_Regression_Model_PricePredictor
Using Python and Regression Model Machine Learning to predict BTC next day closing price.


As a capstone project for the Data Science Course from 
https://verticalinstitute.com/data-science/

The course covers the following the structured and practical use of:
- NumPy & Pandas
- Data Cleaning, Visualization & Exploratory Data Analysis
- Linear Regression and Feature Scaling
- Classification Models

This project aims not so much as to discover the ‘holy grail’ in a single exercise, but
to build an initial model for further continual improvement; applying Machine
Learning models to allow forecast of future closing price.

The modeling looks promising but can be made more robust by:
- researching other independent variables, such as time of day, opening/closing hour, and so on.
- expanding comparison or integration with other models like LSTM,etc.
- expanding to other assets and see if we have similar results.
- research whether sudden deviations like price spikes are related to sudden news, and hence it
could be useful to add other Machine Learning tools like Sentiment Analysis.

Also, the process can be further refined and standardized.

In real use, friction like slippages, execution latencies, liquidity have to be taken into consideration.
